## Hi, I'm John

### About Me
1. I like algorithms, especially graphs related ones. Unravelling something as complex as a graph is truly fascinating
2. I specialise in app development and have been implementing full stack server applications for the past 2 years
3. Programming languages should be statically typed

### My Current Project
Currently I am working on a social media mobile app revolving around the idea of events / outings / plans. The technologies used are GraphQL, MongoDB, Golang on the back end and React Native on the front end.
